As more and more data are used in technology and data science, storing data in an efficient way is becoming hugely important. In this workshop, we will be learning how to make use of TerminusDB, an open-source git-like database to build a knowledge graph with the bike-share data (https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bikeshare/). After the workshop, participants will learn how to store data in knowledge graphs and make use of graph data in their projects.

This workshop will be consisting of a 30 mins talk by the creator of TerminusDB - Gavin Mendel Gleason, followed by a 60 mins hands-on workshop. Bring a charged laptop if you want to benefit from the workshop!
