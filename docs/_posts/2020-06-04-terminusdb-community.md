In TerminusDB, we have a lovely community and user group that is very active on Discord. We also have weekly webinars and WOQL tutorials. As an open-source software, we care a lot about our users and we are ready to put a lot of effort in developer relations. This week we will have our Developer Relations Lead - Cheuk Ting Ho to answer all questions related to DevRel, Community and working with TerminusDB.

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.
