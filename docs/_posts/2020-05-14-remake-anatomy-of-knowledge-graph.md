Due to the high demand, we are going to do a REMAKE of our first Webinar: Anatomy of a Knowledge Graph where we have Kevin Feeney, CEO of TerminusDB and Gavin Mendel-Gleason, CTO and creator of TerminusDB to answer questions about knowledge graph, design choices of TerminusDB and comparing TerminusDB to other graph databases.

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.

When: May 14th, 2020 4:00 PM BST/IST (3:00 PM UTC, 5:00 PM CET)
