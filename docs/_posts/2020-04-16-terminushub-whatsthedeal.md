In TerminusDB HQ, we are woking very hard to make TerminusHub happened. It is an epic journey and it has a grand vision - to share and collaborate data like GitHub. So, what's the deal regarding TerminusHub? When can we use it? What can I do with it? Will it be free? This week, I will interview Kevin Feeney, CEO of TerminusDB, (again) to ask about the current state of Hub and answer all the questions that we have in mind.

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.

When: April 16, 2020 4:00 PM BST/IST (3:00 PM UTC, 5:00 PM CET)

Topic: TerminusDB Webinar - TerminusHub, what's the deal?
