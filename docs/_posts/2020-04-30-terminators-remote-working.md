Two-third of the world has been in lockdown for a month now. However, it has been a productive month for our TerminusDB team. We are working fast to prepare for the release of Hub next month. How did we do that? How does a start-up tech company face this challenge and adopt the changes? How would this pandemic affect the business of the tech industry? We ask Luke Feeney, our business and operations lead these questions.

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.

When: April 30, 2020 4:00 PM BST/IST (3:00 PM UTC, 5:00 PM CET)

Topic: TerminusDB Webinar - chat with Female Terminators
