The TerminusDB team are not just tech geniuses, we also have musical talent. Last month we have made a parody of a pop song and we named it "Super Database": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNbc44TGBTc Today we have the star of the video - Sreya to be in our webinar. She also takes care of the core TerminusDB team on daily bases. Let's ask her what does she think of the team and the making of "Super Database".

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.

When: June 18th, 2020 4:00 PM BST/IST (3:00 PM UTC, 5:00 PM CET)

Topic: Star of Super Database
