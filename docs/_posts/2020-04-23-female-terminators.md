In this Webinar, rather than focus on just tech, we want to know more about the core team behind TerminusDB. Currently, we have 2 female developers in the dev team (out of 6, not bad), and I have some questions to ask them. We want to be inspired not just by technological knowledge, but also by their experience as a developer in a male-dominated industry. Join us in the Webinar if you want to be inspired!

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.

When: April 23, 2020 4:00 PM BST/IST (3:00 PM UTC, 5:00 PM CET)

Topic: TerminusDB Webinar - chat with Female Terminators
