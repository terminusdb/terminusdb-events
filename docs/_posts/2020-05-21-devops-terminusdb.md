One type of questions that we get a lot are questions related to operations and administrations when using TerminusDB. That's why this week we have our devops super star in the core TerminusDB team, Robin de Rooij, to join us in the webinar and answer some frequent asked questions.

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.

When: May 21st, 2020 4:00 PM BST/IST (3:00 PM UTC, 5:00 PM CET)

Topic: TerminusDB Webinar - Devops and TerminusDB
