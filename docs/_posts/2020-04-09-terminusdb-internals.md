As enthusiastic Terminators, we all want to know how TerminusDB works. We want to know how with Prolog and Rust it works like magic: provide functions like git, allows rollback, branch and merge. In this webinar, we will ask our BDFL Gavin Mendel-Gleason -- creator of TerminusDB, technical and no so technical questions about TemrinusDB internals.

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.

When: April 9, 2020 4:00 PM BST/IST (3:00 PM UTC, 5:00 PM CET)

Topic: TerminusDB Webinar - TerminusDB Internals
