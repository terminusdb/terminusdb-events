Have you seen our videos about our roadmap? It's cute and informative about how our personal experienced using TerminusDB. Do you want to know the making of it? How it guided us in our development? And maybe how to apply this in your team as well? This week we will have our Director Of Services talking about how to make all these "episodes" to guide development and why is it good practice.

If you have questions that you want to ask already, you can do so by tagging #TerminatorsOnTech and @TerminusDB on Twitter.

When: June 11th, 2020 4:00 PM BST/IST (3:00 PM UTC, 5:00 PM CET)
